# Webcam Mod 

Works for Minecraft version ~~1.21.4~~1.21.1

## Disclamer

It shouldn't be used on public servers, only with people you trust. I think it's pretty easy to send a malicious payload and crash your game (or worse!). Use at your own risk.

Also, this isn't production-ready. I made it for a YouTube video: https://youtu.be/pRvUX16k6yw

## Features

Adds your webcam's feed to your player and displays it in real time. It works great on LAN, and I tested it on an online server with two players (I don't know if more players are too much load for the server).

This is a server/client mod, so it needs to be installed on both.
